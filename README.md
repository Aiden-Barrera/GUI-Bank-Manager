# GUI-Bank-Manager
GUI for a Bank Manager I designed in Python with the use of customTkinter. The BankGUI python file is the main driver file for this project, but the banking python file has it's own driver to run on it's own using the terminal. 

# BankGUI.py 
This is the main Python File I developed to run and showcase the Bank Manager GUI. To view the contents, download the Bank Manager Python Folder in this repository and in your local environment, run the BankGUI.py file. 

# banking.py
This is the helper Python File I developed to hold the functions and backend functionality for the GUI. This helper file does contain it's own driver which does the same thing the GUI does but in your Terminal. 

# Download 
To experience the GUI I developed download the Bank Manager Python folder or clone the repository and open the folder in your local environment and run the BankGUI.py file.
